**Objective**
This code was written by David Bodey for a Coursera full-stack interview. I was provided a Figma and asked to develop the code that would generate the given design with a mobile breakpoint. It utilizes React for structure and Bulma for styling.

Example deployment (slow load speed with free/offline Heroku server): 
https://thawing-brushlands-17759.herokuapp.com

### (Please use Node v16 as v17 has a temporary issue. https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11579)

In the project directory, you can test by running:

**First Time Running**:
1) Install Node.js v16 (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Download Project from GitHub
3) Open Terminal --> Navigate inside unzipped, downloaded folder using `cd` until you can see the package.json file from `ls` on OSX or `dir` if using windows
4) Run `npm install` in terminal
5) Run `npm start` in terminal (Runs the app in development mode)
6) Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
